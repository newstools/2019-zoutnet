Dr Ramathuba encouraged residents in the province to assist her department by submitting their written and verbal inputs, which will help to transform the health-care system. Dr Ramathuba, who was accompanied by councillors and senior officials from her department, was speaking on Monday at the Nancefield community hall in Musina. “We are here as the department to share with you what the NHI is all about and the positive impact it will bring. We have been in some districts in the province and the Vhembe District was the last in the five districts in the province we have visited,” said Dr Ramathuba. She said that a healthy lifestyle was a basic human right and it must accessible to all people, regardless how poor they were. Ramathuba mentioned that the cut-off date for written inputs on the NHI Bill was 28 November. “We need a constructive criticism of the bill, so that the NHI funds could cater for all people in the country. We want to create a health insurance that will benefit and help even the poorest of the poorest,” Dr Ramathuba said. She added that the insurance fund would cater for permanent residents of the country, while asylum seekers would get emergency services.  The MEC for Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba.  Email:
