She now needs votes to secure her spot to represent Limpopo in the finals on 16 December in Durban. Miss Eagle South Africa is a women’s empowerment contest using the beauty-with-brains-and-purpose platform to empower young women to grow and develop themselves by making a positive impact in their communities. As part of the charity work, Mutshenawamadi motivates pupils at local schools. "I also do my charity work by visiting and spending a day with children at a centre for children living with disabilities. This pageant is teaching me how to engage myself in community work, how to venture into entrepreneurship and build my own brand as public figure," she said. “I entered Empress South Africa because modelling is my passion and I've always wanted to find myself in national competitions and to win them. I love modelling because it is where a young woman can showcase her potential.” She said that she wanted to explore more in the modelling industry and be an inspiration to her peers. "I want to empower, inspire and motivate women to have a positive impact on their communities," she added. Mutshenawamadi is a fourth-year student studying for a BA in Language Practice at the University of Venda.  Empress South Africa semi-finalist Vhatendi Mutshenawamadi. Photo supplied.
