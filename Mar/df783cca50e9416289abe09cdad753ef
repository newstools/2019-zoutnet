Community leader Vhakoma Vho Livhuwani Ravhura, who happened to be at the scene, said it has become one of the most disturbing issues in the community. “There is never a week that passes by without an incident of crime here. We are no longer safe here and we must hide ourselves in houses when it is dark, but even there we are not safe as they even break doors to commit crime. There has been so many robberies and killings where firearms were used,” he said.
