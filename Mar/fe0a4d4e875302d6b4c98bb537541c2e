Jubilations abounded as people, especially members of his church, the New Galilee Zion Apostolic Church, danced in celebration of Sithubi’s life. Sithubi was the son of the late Nkhumeleni and mother Bele. He was born on 8 May 1929 at the sub-village of Tshitavha, also in Lwamondo. He started his primary education at Matatani before he proceeded to Tshakhuma.  As he was one of the few people who were educated in the village, Sithubi assisted many families by reading letters from their families in Gauteng. He later worked for the railways in City Deep and retired in 1984. After his retirement, he started fixing people’s shoes and patching sink tins.  He later learnt to fix watches, a job that he did for many years. Because of his desire to see families united, he started Mashie Burial Society, of which he became the treasurer. Sithubi was first baptized at the Lutheran Church before he joined New Galilee. He passed away on 2 March and was buried last Saturday. He had 17 children, six of whom later passed on, with 34 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.  The final resting place of Bishop Sithubi.
