News - Date: 08 March 2019 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 337 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Vhembe region has criticized the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) for not being transparent on the issue of the termination of the contract of the former municipal manager, Mr Reuben Rambado. Rambado and the VDM apparently came to an agreement and, even though his contract ended in February, he will receive a salary for a further eight months. A source from within the VDM, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that both the lawyers representing the municipality and the former municipal manager had met and decided to settle the matter. “They agreed that the former municipal manager should be getting his salary for a further eight months,” said the source. The DA leader in the region, Mr Joseph Mariba, said that Rambado had to take responsibility for the funds wasted during his term as municipal manager. “We want Rambado to pay back the money as he was the municipal manager when the district invested money with the now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank,” said Mariba. The VDM’s executive mayor, Mavhungu Lurule-Ramakhanya, declined to comment on the termination of Rambado’s services, saying the issue was still in court. During a special council meeting, Lurule-Ramakhanya also announced the appointment of a new acting chief financial officer (CFO), Mr David Mufamadi. He replaces Mr Niko Mchavi, who left the municipality in the wake of the investigations concerning the VBS Mutual Bank investments.
