News - Date: 22 March 2019 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 1203 Two men who were allegedly involved in a dramatic shooting at a busy Sibasa intersection appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court. The two suspects are the 40-year-old Colbert Nemukula and the 29-year-old Franklin Khumbudzo Khubana. Nemukula allegedly fired the shots. Khubana is believed to be a policeman stationed at one of the police stations in Gauteng. They face charges of attempted murder, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. The gun used in the shooting is believed to be the policeman's service pistol. Their cases were postponed to 19 March 2019 for bail applications. Police investigations are also continuing. Their arrest and subsequent court appearance are the sequel to the daring shooting of a 63-year-old man near the Total garage at Sibasa a fortnight ago. The incident happened at around 08:00 in the morning. The shooting elicited a lot of speculation but was widely believed to be the result of the ongoing taxi violence in the area. The violence has claimed many lives in Limpopo, with two killings reported late last year when two well-known taxi operators, one at Thohoyandou Block F and one at Maniini, were shot execution style. The Vhembe area has become a killing field where guns are the main killing instruments. Early this year, two well-known unionists, Mr Timmy Tshililo Musetsho and Mr Ronnie Mani, were mercilessly gunned down in what is believed to be contract killings.
