News - Date: 10 June 2019 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 627 The new executive mayor of Vhembe District, Cllr Dowelani Nenguda, has issued a stern warning to employees who violate the supply-chain management policy, that they will be dealt with accordingly. Nenguda said that the district municipality recently submitted a report on unauthorized, irregular and fruitless expenditure to the provincial treasury department. He urged his team to adhere to the supply-chain polices and apply consequence management where necessary. He was speaking during an ordinary council meeting in the Vhembe council chamber last Wednesday and used the day to announce some of his mayoral committee members. “Today, we can proudly say through this council that many issues that led to the Vhembe District to be classified under the category of dysfunctionality have been addressed. However, the audit opinion of the district is still a very serious challenge and it will need a concerted effort by all of us. This council should take note that we have been battling with historic issues, hence the poor audit outcome, but now is the right time to open a new chapter for the district,” said Nenguda. He also said that the R1.7 billion budget for this financial year would be presented to the communities very soon, where water and sanitation would get the lion’s share as they were a water-services district municipality. He announced that the different portfolio heads are Cllrs Thina Mbedzi (technical services), Joe Chavani (corporate services), Ndivhuwo Radamba (budget and finance), Rose Mathukha (community services) and Mbulaheni Magada (planning and development).
