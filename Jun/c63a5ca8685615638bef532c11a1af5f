The outspoken leader appeared in the Vuwani Magistrate’s Court on Monday. He was arrested on 7 May on charges of intimidation related to the contravention of the Electoral Act. His case was postponed to 26 July for further investigations. The R5 000 bail that was granted by the same court during his first appearance has been extended. Speaking after the postponement, Mulaudzi said he was worried that the case was taking much longer and was draining him financially. “I said before that this case is politically motivated and that they are just trying to demoralize me and the community. I still maintain I did nothing wrong, but now I must from time to time attend court.” He added that he was losing a lot on transport and on his own time. “The legal team needs to be paid every time they appear on my behalf," he said. Mulaudzi said it had become a norm in the SA legal system that small cases took a long time, which led to backlogs in cases. "But as a law-abiding South African, I will just wait for the wheels of justice to move at their own pace, but it is a known fact that justice delayed is justice denied," he said.
