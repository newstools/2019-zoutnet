Accompanied by the acting municipal manager, Ms Sylvia Ndou, and members of his executive committee, Nenguda arrived at the R48.9 million project last Thursday, where the contractors, Diges Group and consultants, and TM Africa Engineering Services briefed the team before taking them on a tour around the site. The project started on 7 August 2018 and it is expected to be completed by 13 November this year. The group was informed that the project was 55% completed and the construction of the 2 ML clearwater reservoir was standing at 96 % completed. At least five local businesspeople benefitted from the project by supplying sand and the amount of about R121 000 was paid to them. More than 60 local people are employed as labourers at the project, while the sub-contractor employs eight people. The project has reportedly lost a total of 11 working days – seven days as a result of rainy, inclement weather and four days because of a strike.
