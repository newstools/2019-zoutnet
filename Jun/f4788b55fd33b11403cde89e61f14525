News - Date: 01 June 2019 Written by: Phathutshedzo Luvhengo / Viewed: 321 A woman who was stabbed by her partner to such an extent that some of her intestines were hanging out of her stomach has welcomed the sentencing of the man who almost killed her. Ms Tendani Nesongozwi from Tshikuwi village, who can vividly recall the chain of events on the night she almost got killed, applauded the justice system. This follows the sentencing of Langanani Bulala by the Dzanani Magistrate’s Court last Wednesday. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempted murder. The mother of three was attacked in September 2018 and stabbed 16 times all over her body, leaving her with her intestines hanging outside her stomach. She recalled that the incident started when he was looking for a R10 note as well as a razor. He then started fighting with her, continually assaulting her, and he eventually pulled out a knife and stabbed her multiple times. She said the man then ran away and left her for dead, but fortunately she managed to get to her neighbour’s house while bleeding heavily. “I then collapsed and only remember waking up in a hospital bed,” she said. “I stayed in that relationship, hoping that my husband would change his behaviour, but he did not. I think the sentencing is fair and it will be a lesson to other men who abuse their partners,” she said. She thanked the community of Tshikuwi village, her colleagues and her church members who had supported her during the court trial.  “I have seen immense help from this community where people helped me to get through what was happening,” she said. Pastor Mishack Mariba, Ms Tendani Nesongozwi and a member of their church, Mr Shonisani Mamathuntsha. Ms Nesongozwi says that the church members are some of the people who supported her during the court process.  Email:
