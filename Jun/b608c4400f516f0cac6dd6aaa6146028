News - Date: 16 June 2019 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 470 In February, health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba raised eyebrows when she removed the whole management team at Tshilidzini Hospital. This followed several calls from different quarters for improved service at the hospital. The new management team was given a mandate to turn things around at the embattled hospital and was given a period of 100 days to do that. Problems that the hospital was battling with included backlogs in surgery, water shortages, unclaimed corpses and buildings that fell apart. The 100 days the acting management was given to bring about the needed change lapsed last week. During MEC Phophi Ramathuba's visit to the hospital on Friday to assess progress, she could not hide her joy and praised the acting team, saying they were doing a good job as the hospital had brought about a tremendous improvement since the new management came in. Ramathuba said she knew they still had a long way to go in improving things at the hospital but was very impressed by the work already done. "So many things were not going right here and looking at the short space the acting team used to turn things around, I have no doubt that these are the right people here. We only gave them 100 days and many changes have taken place here," Ramathuba said.
