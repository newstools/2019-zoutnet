News - Date: 02 June 2019 Written by: Phathutshedzo Luvhengo / Viewed: 313 The mayor of the Makhado Local Municipality, Cllr Samuel Munyai, is adamant the new graders recently acquired by the municipality will help alleviate the backlog regarding the grading of streets within the municipality’s jurisdiction. On Tuesday, the municipality unveiled two new graders, a TLB, a low-bed truck and a fleet of 19 new vehicles to help improve service delivery. This follows an earlier announcement by Munyai that the municipality was in the process of purchasing new graders. “We had a huge backlog in terms of grading our streets. We are now relieved with this latest purchase, even though it may not be enough. We are planning to buy more graders in the next financial year,” he said. He said that residents should expect the municipality to add more machinery and it will be mentioned in the State of the Municipality Address to be held next month. “We are still going to add machinery that is going to assist our people,” he said. Munyai said that residents should know that the new machinery and vehicles were purchased with their money and they should look after them. “When you see these graders in your area and notice that they are being misused, let the municipality know that those items are no longer doing what they were purchased for,” he said. Munyai said the municipality would evaluate the drivers who would be driving the new vehicles, TLB and graders. He said it would be done to make sure that drivers were still complying and suitable to drive. “That will give us guarantee that our items are in good hands,” he said. He concluded that he would continue working in a manner that would benefit the residents of the municipality.
