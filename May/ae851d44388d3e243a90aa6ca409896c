Thanyani Sithole is the first princess and Natash Asia the second princess. Phindulo walked away with a crown, a sash, a floating trophy and R500 cash. She hails from Madombidzha Zone 2 and is in Grade 12 pupil at Litshovhu Secondary School. She said that she entered the pageant because she believed in herself. "I have a lot of self-confidence. Many young people are afraid to follow their passions, because some people discourage them," she added. "Young people have to follow their passions, irrespective of what people say. Failing is not the end of the world. If you fail, you should try harder."

Her dream is to win Miss Universe and Miss World. She always had a passion for modelling when growing up. "I have loved modelling since my childhood, but I couldn't get any opportunity to participate in modelling. So far, I have participated in Miss Madombidzha Arsenal, Miss Waterval and Miss Face of Courageous. I thank my family for motivating me," she added.

The founder of the pageant, Mr Meshack Ndouvhada, said that the purpose of the pageant was to identify girls with talent and try to uplift them to a higher level.
