This was during the recent Vhembe TVET College Students Excellence and Performance Awards that were held at the Nandoni Riverview. During the event, the top three students in each department were awarded phones, laptops, iPads and trophies. According to the CEO of the TVET college, Ms Basani Hlekane, the purpose of the awards was to encourage the students to work harder. She further indicated that they had noticed that students were not performing well and had introduced the incentives to inspire and encourage them. “The incentives are doing wonders. Since we introduced them, there has been a tremendous improvement in their performance, and we hope this will go a long way in instilling the sense of competition among students.” SRC president Mr Zwidofhela Musekwa said the students were overwhelmed and appreciative of what was being done for them. “We are happy that our hard work is being noticed and recognised at long last. It even motivates us, and we hope that it will continue to happen at all times," Musekwa said. During the event, the college gave boxes of sanitary pads to 12 different secondary schools.
