So far, I have already provided full school uniforms for 30 learners in my ward,” said Cllr Philemon Taxi Nare when handing over uniforms to five learners of Rixile Primary School last Friday. Nare said each year, he engaged with the school-governing body and principal of Rixile Primary and Musina Secondary School, so that each school could identify five learners from needy families who should be provided with school uniforms. “I personally grew up very poor, and I know what real poverty is. I took it upon myself to make sure that I contribute to reducing poverty in my area of jurisdiction.” He said one did not need to have a lot of money to make a difference in the community. “The little you have can make a very big difference in your community. I encourage other community leaders to make a difference in their communities because it takes the whole community to raise a child. Children are the future leaders of our communities, and we all have to mobilise resources to prepare their future.” The principal of Rixile Primary School, Mr Moses Chauke, expressed his appreciation for Nare’s efforts and encouraged other community leaders to follow his example. “Every year, for the past three years, Mr Nare has been handing over uniforms to disadvantaged learners here in our school. We really appreciate his heart of gold and hope that it will be a lesson to other community leaders to make a difference in their communities.”  Cllr Philemon Taxi Nare talks with a Grade 2 learner at Rixile School, Joyce Ndou.
