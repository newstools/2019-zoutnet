News - Date: 13 May 2019 Written by:  / Viewed: 313 “There is nothing more fulfilling than being honoured by your own people while you are still alive. If I die now, I will die a happy man.” These are the words of Pastor Ndwamato Luvhengo (95), one of the three elderly pastors whose religious works were given recognition by Mayor Mihloti Muhlope of Musina a fortnight ago, during an event at the Nancefield Community Hall. Luvhengo, together with Pastor Jeremiah Negogogo (90) and Pastor Mulivha Mulaudzi (84), are pioneers of the Christian faith and the founders of the Musina Council of Churches (MCC), which now has a membership of 35 churches. For many years, Negogogo was the chairperson of the MCC, while Luvhengo and Mulaudzi were deputy chairperson and treasurer respectively. During the event, the three men were each presented with a designer suit, a shirt, a pair of socks, an appreciation certificate and cash. Muhlope said the three elders were very lucky because the tendency was to honour people while they were no longer alive. “We are very happy, because we are celebrating your lives while you are still alive. The saying that a man does not see a beautiful rose in his own garden does not apply to us, because through these elderly pastors, we are seeing beautiful flowers in our own garden here in Musina. Biblically, we can proudly compare them with great religious fathers like Abraham.” Negogogo said they were not working for making names for themselves or for fame. “We are very happy that you are honouring us while we are still alive. We wish the present leadership of the Musina Council of Churches will continue the good work that we have started,” he said.
