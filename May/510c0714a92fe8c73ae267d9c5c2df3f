News - Date: 18 May 2019 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 109 The local traditional leader at Tswinga, Chief Mmbangiseni Alfred Tshishonga, has called on elderly people to continue participating in sport as it will help to improve their health. Tshishonga, who has a soft spot for the elderly, was speaking during the Thulamela Stream A Old Tournament held at the local sports ground last Wednesday. Fourteen teams from different villages took part in the tournament. Ms Azwidohwi Muvhango, one of the tournament coordinators, said that they held such games from time to time and the games were hosted at different villages. The games are aimed at involving the elderly in sports, and they are also busy selecting a squad that will play other municipalities. She said the games also served as a meeting place for the elderly, who spent lonely days alone at home. According to her, the teams have their practice at least twice a week and they encourage the teams to stick to their normal training routine. Chief Mmbangiseni Tshishonga said that the elderly were “our pillars in many families, and we cannot afford to lose them through diseases that could be overcome by merely doing exercises. We urge all of you to participate in sport for a life free of diseases," he said. Thulamela Municipality’s councillor for Ward 36, Mr Joseph Nemalegeni, commended the organisers. "We are deeply indebted to our elderly people. With such games being played, we are sure many will benefit health-wise. Our plea to all is to let us take of them and make them feel worthwhile," he said.  Tournament coordinators Chief Mmbangiseni Tshishonga and some of the elderly, photographed after the tournament.
