News - Date: 24 January 2019 Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 597 Registration at tertiary institutions has become a major headache to institutions and students themselves. That is, however, not the case at the University of Venda, where everything is running smoothly. The university's spokesperson, Mr Takalani Dzaga, said they had been working very hard since opening on 7 January. “Since reopening in January, already more than 12 000 students, new and old, have registered and as of now we are talking of 3 000 to 4 000 old and new students left to register for this academic year. Hopefully we will be done with the registration process on Friday (today),” he said. Dzaga further indicated that they had opened an online late-application facility since Monday that would run for three days. "We are encouraging those who wish to follow the field of agriculture, but they should have obtained a bachelor’s pass and have done the sciences at school," said Dzaga. Ms Salma Patel, SRC secretary general, said they had made history by registering 3100 in the first 10 days of registration. "We have also ensured to have late applications for students who did not apply and are interested in studying here, so that they may endeavour their studies at Univen. We have successfully completed our Right to Learn campaign by successfully registering students coming from poor backgrounds free of charge," Patel said.
