Tshamulovha, who hails from Folovhodwe, said she felt excited, honoured and blessed to win the pageant as the competition was tough. "It wasn't easy, but in the end I managed to beat the other 12 contestants. I thank everyone who supported me through the journey," she added.

She received R1 000, a certificate, a modelling agency contract, clothing gift hampers from the KDS clothing brand and a year contract as an ambassador for KDS clothing.

She was Indoni Miss Cultural South Africa finalist in 2017.

The founder of the pageant, Ms Sedzani Mudau, said that the pageant offered young women a platform to help bring about change in socio-economic issues in order to create a better communal living space and lifestyle. "Our aim is to motivate and inspire young women to believe in themselves, to pursue their dreams and to boost their confidence.” She further said that, as part of their community participation, they planned to use some of the money that they have managed to raise during the event to buy school shoes, school bags and sanitary pads for the school in Muswodi Dipeni, and Malinge Primary School in Niani.

She thanked the sponsors who made the event possible. Ndulamiso Tshamulovha was crowned Miss Niani. Photo supplied.
