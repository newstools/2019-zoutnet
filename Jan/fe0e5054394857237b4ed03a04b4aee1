The mayor visited the farm school to encourage learners to take education seriously from the beginning of the academic year. Muhlope told Memory Ndou that the fact that she resided on a farm should not have a negative impact on her future. “Your future and development do not have anything to do with where you come from. Yes, we understand that you come from a farming area where resources are very limited. But your positive attitude and zeal to succeed will play a meaningful role in the realisation of your future dreams.” She said supporting local schools was important, because that was where future leaders were developed. “Government is doing its best to make sure that our children’s education is accessed with ease. The state is providing books, food and transport to learners, so that they can learn without problems. There is no child who can give an excuse that he or she cannot go to school because of poverty.” School principal Mr Samson Nekhubvi said the mayor’s visit would ignite his staff to start the year on a high note.
