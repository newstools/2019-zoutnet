News - Date: 21 January 2019 Written by: Ndivhuwo Musetha / Viewed: 140 The Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC), is urging community members to use the forthcoming registration weekend to get their names on the voter’s roll. According to the IEC’s district coordinator in Vhembe, Mr Jeffrey Radzilani, the electoral body is concerned about the low response by community members to register with the IEC for the upcoming elections to be held in May. Radzilani said the government felt that not enough awareness had been created with voters to register with IEC. Next Saturday and Sunday (26 and 27 January) will be the last days for potential voters to register with the IEC before the President announces the election day proclamation. Once the date has been announced, registration will be closed. The IEC’s main concern is the youth aged between 18 and 19 as they are showing the least interest in participating in this important democratic process. According to Radzilani, only 16% of the age group is registered to vote for this year’s national elections in Limpopo. The age group between 20 and 30 is more pleasing, because 50% of this age group have registered. “Our last concern is the issue of updating addresses for those who have registered. Mostly, people from rural areas are the ones who have not updated or registered their address with us,” said Radzilani. Asked why the registration was so low among the youth, Radzilani cited a lack of awareness and poor knowledge of the democratic process. “We also encourage political parties to take it upon themselves to urge votes to register on this weekend as they have a vested interest,” said Radzilani.
