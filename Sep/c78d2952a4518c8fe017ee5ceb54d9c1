News - Date: 22 September 2019 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 390 Several schools around Tshifudi outside Thohoyandou in the Vhumbedzi Circuit are set to benefit from a donation of trees by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF). More than 120 trees were distributed to Mphandeli, Ntodeni, Funzwani and Thomani secondary schools and Gonela Primary on Friday during Arbor month celebrations that were held at Mphandeli Secondary School. Mr Azwitamisi Ramasimu, a forester in the DAFF’s Makwarela office, said part of the handing over of trees was natural restoration, which would make schools have shade and fruit trees and take part in the nutrition programme. “We will also temporarily employ 76 unemployed community members for planting trees along the banks of rivers through the programme called River Rinse, and 950 trees will be planted. We target to distribute over 350 trees around the Vhembe District and hope schools and communities will benefit from our programme,” said Ramasimu. Chief education specialist Mr Conway Mukhodobwane said they had subjects such as geography, agricultural science and life sciences in schools focusing on the environment and, through planting trees, “we will link the theoretical and practical work among learners”. According to Mukhodobwane, as the department of education, they had an obligation to develop learners who showed their responsibilities towards the environment. The principal of Mphandeli Secondary School in Tshifudi village, Mr Tshimangadzo Mudau, was very happy that local schools will benefit from the donation of trees.   Email:
