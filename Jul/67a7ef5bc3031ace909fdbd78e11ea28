Ramuhashi (79) of Ha-Nesengani Tshifhefhe in the Vuwani area passed on last week after a long illness. He was buried on Saturday at the local cemetery. A memorial service in his honour was held on Friday at his home. Chief Nemulalo Ramukhuba, an executive member of the Vhembe Contralesa, paid a glowing tribute to Ramuhashi, saying he was a tower over the rest regarding issues of community development. Ramuhashi respected them, even though they were younger than him, he added. He was also described as a workaholic “who made mother earth his friend as a farmer”. He also had a bakery in the village, which supplied the village. Ramukhuba urged others to emulate him and to follow in his footsteps and to continue where he left off in assisting the community. Ramuhashi was born at Mashau village and moved to Thomo village and later relocated to Ha-Nesengani Tshifhefhe in 1968. He is survived by four of his seven wives, two sisters, a brother, 34 of his 45 children and many grandchildren.  Mr Nnditsheni Josias Ramuhashi's casket is taken away to a waiting hearse.
