Fulufhedzani Mulovhedzi was touched by the plight of the refugees staying at the shelter that is run by the Musina Ministry Compassion Church. Last year, she started the #WarmAheart campaign, aimed at making life a bit more comfortable for the men staying at the shelter. She realised that most of them slept on the floor without blankets. Mulovhedzi used social media to run a campaign and collect blankets. Last year, her aim was to collect 250 blankets, but she could only manage to get 180. This year she is aiming to collect 450 blankets. She has already collected 300 blankets that were donated to the refugees. “I just wish to keep as many people as possible warm. My target is normally based on how many people the refuge or shelter has,” she explained, adding that she would continue campaigning until all the refugees at the shelter had warm blankets. Speaking to Limpopo Mirror, Jeanclaude Mbayo from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said: “I am very happy to receive a blanket. All along I had one very thin blanket that I picked up here at the shelter, which could not keep me warm.” Mbayo arrived in South Africa in June this year.
