The fire was apparently caused by a burning candle in the room where the two had slept. They were living in a house that was not electrified. All the belongings of the two gogos were destroyed by the fire. The sound of hymns was overpowered by weeping and wailing during the first funeral of its kind at the village. “We have accepted what happened, although we know we will never get over it. The pain we experience as a family is more than words can express,” said Mr Lutendo Tshivhula, grandson of both deceased. Vhamusanda Vho-Ntanganedzeni Kutama said as leader he was forced to make sure that the two elderly ladies were buried with dignity and respect. "Their deaths have touched our hearts and we are united with the family and other stakeholders to make sure that the two receive a dignified burial."  Pastors and family members photographed at the coffins of the two elderly ladies.  Kaizer Nengovhela started writing stories for Limpopo Mirror more than a decade ago, in 2 000.
