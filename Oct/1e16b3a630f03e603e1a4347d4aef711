News - Date: 20 October 2019 Written by: Maanda Bele / Viewed: 272 While communities use the festive season for fun and relaxation, to some people it brings some opportunities to perform criminal activities. This year, members of the South African Youth Against Crime (SAYAC) have promised a safe and crime-free festive season. SAYAC is a non-profit organisation that was established in 2016 and deals mostly with crime prevention, public safety and skills development. The chairperson of the organisation, Mr Richard Ramabulana, said that people hardly enjoyed the festive season because of gangs who were always ready to rob people of their hard-earned belongings and spoil the festive mood. “I recall one incident about a year ago where people were forced to get out of the resorts because a gang was misbehaving.” He said that their aim this year would be to let people feel safe and that they had already started with marshalling where events such as the famous Kids and Mascots show at Mphephu Resort took place to ensure that the people were safe. SAYAC was recently funded to the tune of R15 000 by Matasis Investment Company to make sure that they are on guard this festive season. Anyone who wants to assist SAYAC can phone Ramabulana on 064 979 6429 or send an email to Richard.sayac@outlook.com or visit their Facebook page: South African Youth Against Crime.  South African Youth Against Crime (SAYAC) members are ready to assist during the festive season.
