News - Date: 12 October 2019 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 686 Three learners of the Mbilwi Secondary School recently won a public-speaking competition organized by the Department of Water and Sanitation. Mavhungu Mavhusha, Nyamudzhedzi Nemanashe and Tshedza Nemavhola, all in Grade 11 and 16 years of age, were on cloud nine on Monday at an event held in school’s square when an official from the department presented them with bursaries to further their studies. The principal of the school, Mr Cedrick Lidzhade, said that his school was the top school in the province and “we are always winners, as both learners and educators are hard workers. These learners have made life easier for their parents as they will pay their tuition fees themselves with the bursaries they won”. The acting director of water sector support in the department, Mr Ronald Matukane, said the learners would have to study towards water-related courses in their tertiary education, so that they could help the department after getting their degrees. One of the learners, Mavhungu Mavhusha, said that they would work hard to pass their matric with flying colours, so that they would be able to use their bursaries fruitfully.
