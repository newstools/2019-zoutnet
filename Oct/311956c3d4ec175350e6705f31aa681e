When asked how she felt, Sinyosi said that she was very happy because it was a huge achievement. “I was competing with the best principals from nine districts in Limpopo. Receiving this award in front of all those academics, MECs, DDGs, District directors, circuit managers, and other participants from various categories made me cry; it was too much for me.” Sinyosi became the principal of Dzata in 2013 and since then the school’s performance has been more than an 86% pass rate in Grade 12. “We achieve this through hard work, working as a team.
