Siblings, family members and friends of Tshauambea could not contain themselves when his coffin went down at the local graveyard on Saturday. Tshauambea died in the early hours of September 21, following an incident at a beer hall in Ha-Mutsha where he was stabbed in the heart. According to his father, Khathutshelo Tshauambea, he was stabbed several times by a group of seven boys after he tried to protect his elder brother, Mulalo. The brother was allegedly attacked by the group, wielding knives and pangas. “This incident happened around Saturday, midnight or around Sunday morning. I received a call from a relative of my wife’s who said she had been informed by another person that our son had been stabbed to death at a lounge in Ha-Malutsha. I immediately left my house and walked to the scene in the company of his uncle, Khuthadzo,” he said. When the two men arrived at the tavern, they found Mulalo lying in a pool of blood on the side of the tar road. “He was badly injured with serious stab wounds. He was also unconscious. His uncle, Khuthadzo, said we must get inside the lounge. We then found Mulinda also lying in a pool of blood. He was already dead,” said Khathutshelo. Mulalo was taken to Tshilidzini hospital where he stayed from Sunday morning until Friday, September 27, when he was discharged. He also attended his younger brother Mulinda’s funeral. The boys’ father said he was hurt because he had lost a son and nearly lost another one. “I wish the perpetrators will face the full might of the law,” he said. Last week one of the suspects was allegedly stoned and torched at Tshakhuma village. Four of the other suspects were arrested while the other two were still at large.  The late Mulinda Tshauambea.
