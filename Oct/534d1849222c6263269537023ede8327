News - Date: 24 October 2019 Written by: Bernard Chiguvare / Viewed: 807 Although the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) indicated that they are ready to work on resolving the water crisis in Tshikota, it is fearing for the safety of the workers. This follows last week’s violent protest by Tshikota residents, demanding that the VDM restore the regular supply of water to the area. Residents went on the rampage last week, blocking off entry roads to the area. “We are ready to make sure that for the interim water be shared between Louis Trichardt and residents of Tshikota, while processing the drilling of boreholes to supply high level areas, but we are unable to do that because some members of the community do not want the Vhembe District Municipality team to go there and work. So, the safety of our team is not guaranteed,” said Moses Shibambu, spokesperson from the VDM. Last week’s unrest left six police officers injured and twelve Tshikota residents arrested. The twelve have already appeared in the local magistrate court and their case was postponed to 15 November 2019. At the time of going to press everything seemed calm in Tshikota, but none of the residents wanted to comment on the situation. Scenes from last week's unrest in Tshikota when roads were barricaded.
